#summary Phantom development plan.
#labels Featured,Phase-Requirements

= Nearest Goal =

To produce distributable alpha-level OS which can be programmed for by 3rd party programmers.

= Userland/Tools Tasks =

Quite crirtical tasks.

  * *Java bytecode compiler*. Have skeleton, need complete one.
  * *Hosted test env. multithreading*. Must be easy.
  * *Hosted test env. TCP access*. Ditto.
  * *Windowing env Z-buffer*. 
  * *Windowing evants, input, event thread pools*. 
  * *VM and compiler support for floats/doubles/64 bit ints*. 
  * *More of Phantom language implementation in compiler*. Closures, direct containers support.

Not critical, but can be done relatively easily.

  * *Border objects and restart exceptions*. Especially for TCP interfaces.

Not so easy, but we need it, sooner or later.

  * *Python compiler*. Seems to be a good possible object env shell and common scripting language. Or shall it be Ruby instead?

= Kernel Tasks =

  * *VirtIO drivers*. Have partial VirtIO environment, need complete disk and net drivers.
  * *IDE driver cleanup*. Driver supports interrupts and BM but does not use them!
  * *Partition lookup code*. None at all.
  * *IP stack tests and userland interface*. 

Not critical, but can be done relatively easily.

  * *Disk selection*. Right now Phantom looks for its disk in hardcoded places.


= General Project Support Tasks =

We need volunteers for these:

  * *Doxygen*. And code documentation too.
  * *Test suite, regular regression test setup*. 
  * *Code review*. Need code review process to be set up and carried.
  * *Good internal document(s) on development process*. For new members to jump in easily.
  * *Define branching/merging rules*. We will have to have release branches.
