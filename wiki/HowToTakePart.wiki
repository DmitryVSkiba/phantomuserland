#summary How to take a part in project.
#labels Featured

  * Contact Dmitry Zavalishin (dz), dz@dz.ru - please don't forget to add 'phantom' word to the subject line.
  * Read [http://code.google.com/p/phantomuserland/source/browse/#svn/trunk/doc dox]
  * Checkout project and setup required environment.
  * Select subsystem to care of (see RoadMap) or some subsystem-independent role, such as to work on documentation or testing.
  * Decide with dz and/or with subsystem lead what to do first.
  * Do it!
  * Take a look at CodingStyle to do it right.

Very good start is to do some code review for the part you want to work on, and, possibly, to write some regression tests for it. 

Some possible tasks:

  * AHCI driver
  * virtio disk/net drivers (partially done)
  * USB HC drivers
  * ARM port :)
